        Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, was founded with the noble
        vision to raise professionals and leaders of high academic calibre and
        unblemished character, nurtured with a strong motivation and commitment
        to serve humanity. The institution is the fulfillment of the vision of
        its founders Late Dr. D. G. S. Dhinakaran and the present Chancellor Dr.
        Paul Dhinakaran. Established in 1986 as an Engineering College, it was
        granted an autonomous status in 1999 and declared Deemed-to-be
        University by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in recognition of
        its academic excellence by the Ministry of Human Resources Development
        under section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956 vide notification no 9-3-2000-U3
        dated 23.6.2004 of the Government of India. Accredited by NAAC, the
        institution offers a wide array of Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral
        Degree programmes in various branches of Engineering, Biotechnology,
        Food processing and Agricultural Sciences. From a humble beginning of
        180 students, the institution has rapidly grown to 8491 students and 452
        faculty representing 18 academic departments. In the three decades of
        service to higher education, Karunya Institute of Technology and
        Sciences has made significant progression in teaching learning, research
        and consultancy, innovation and transfer of technology, community
        service and value education. Translating the vision of the Founders into
        action, the institution is currently engaged in finding solutions to
        human problems in the four major areas such as Water, Food, Healthcare,
        and Energy through scientific and technological interventions.

        Drones rely on a combination of hardware and software components to
        achieve successful takeoff, flight and landing. Drones are often
        equipped with rotors or fixed wings, sensors, navigation systems and
        gyroscopes (for stability), and are operated by ground control stations.
